    "text": "Welcome to the world of Naruto! This is a world of action and adventure. Of Ninja and Samurai. Of hidden darkness and…aliens?\n\nWhatever it includes, it begins on a continent composed of the Elemental Nations. Within most of these nations are special cities called Hidden Villages, which are run by Ninja, mercenaries trained to use the power of Chakra to perform superhuman feats such as enhancing speed and strength, manifesting the five elements, creating illusions, and much, much more. This is a world that is fraught with danger and conflict, though it currently enjoys a somewhat strained peace. Not for long, however. There are powerful forces stirring in the shadows. Hidden Sand and Hidden Sound are preparing for their assault on Konoha, and the Akatsuki have begun to move. You begin your journey in this world the day before Naruto’s graduation exam."

        "text": "SAGE MODE\n\nMany view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that is not true. A Sage is something more, a being who does not just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world.\n\nSages utilize a specialized form of jutsu called senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage's strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced.\n\nBy utilizing senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that before, then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu, the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques.\n\nAs you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound.\n\nYou may instead gain a custom set of unique abilities of a similar power level, based on where and how you learned Sage Mode. If you wish to have access to additional versions, you can pay 50 CP extra for each.\n\nHowever, this comes with a downside. If too much natural energy is taken in, it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still. If in a fight, you cannot stay utterly still, then your reserve of senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on.\n\nBy paying for it here, you will find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra. Even in a life and death battle, the process will always go correctly.\n\nNormally you would require large chakra reserves, but you have found a way around that. Another thing to remember is if you continually practice the use of senjutsu, the time needed to refill your senjutsu reserves will decrease.\n\nFor an additional 400 CP (FREE: Jūbi Jinchūriki), you can obtain Six Paths Senjutsu, a version of senjutsu vastly superior to regular senjutsu.\n\nFor starters, every boost you get from regular senjutsu is massively enhanced to the point you that you can sense beings like Madara's Limbo clones and dodge lightspeed attacks.\n\nSecondly, you are immune to all but senjutsu enhanced attacks. Thirdly, Six Paths Senjutsu enhances any dōjutsu you possess. An example of this is Obito using Kamui and what little Six Paths chakra he had left to somehow give his Sharingan to Kakashi temporarily while he was in Limbo. Another example is Kakashi being able to use the perfect Susanoo without any of the prior forms.\n\nFinally, you gain access to Yin and Yang natures as well as Yin-Yang release and Truth-Seeking Balls along with the ability of flight.\n\nAs far as abilities go, the versions the Jūbi Jinchūriki have and what Naruto gets are the same but with different appearances. Naruto's eyes changed to be similar to when he uses Sage mode in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode but without the markings or the chakra cloak, the Jūbi Jinchūriki either has fleshy mutations like Obito or clothes made of senjutsu chakra like Madara.\n\nFor the purposes of this perk, if you are not a Jūbi Jinchūriki, assume that your Six Paths Sage Mode is similar in appearance to Naruto's, only tailored to what animal summon you chose to learn from.",

You are able to identify injuries and other ailments with merely a glance and treat conditions others have deemed impossible. For example, your skills in the medical arts is such that you could heal the necrosis caused by the Dead Demon Consuming Seal or the psychological torture inflicted by Tsukuyomi, easily create cures against the poisons of the great Chiyo, and even heal yourself after being cut in half. There is nothing you cannot heal given time. Obviously, this comes with all the medical knowledge one would expect for a medic of your caliber; one example of this is your knowledge of the cellular structure and, if you were to perform an autopsy, you could easily detect damage at the cellular level and immediately tell what could have caused it and what exactly happened. Of course, to keep your title you can’t just coast by on what you know. So now and in all future Jumps, all attempts to increase knowledge relating to medicine and healing will be learnt ten times faster than every other so-called medic.",

Note that the Jinchūriki General Perk is not required to purchase a Beast from this section.\n\nYou may choose to be a Jinchūriki of any Beast on offer in this section, and you may purchase more than one if you so choose. At your discretion, you may replace the canon Jinchūriki of the Beast you select, though this will not grant you any of their abilities that do not stem from their Jinchūriki status, and it depends on you to befriend your Beast(s).\n\nBy default, the seal that holds your Beast prevents them from affecting you emotionally or mentally, but you can remove this effect to gain 200 JP. Your seal also prevents its escape. If you were to ever die, the Beast would die with you, and if you were to come back, it would still be imprisoned inside you.\n\nYou can control the seal - the more open it is, the more chakra you can draw from your Beast(s). Open it too much without a strong bond and they may try to drain your chakra in return. This control is separate for every Beast if you have more than one. You can decide the seal's design and, if you host multiple Beasts, how many seals appear on your body, including hiding them entirely.\n\nAnother feature of being a Jinchūriki is a mindscape - a mental space where you can interact with your Beast(s). Its appearance is entirely up to you and, if you buy multiple Beasts, each can receive their own mindscape if you so wish.\n\nThe Beasts on offer here can be divided into three sets: the Tailed Beasts, the Genryū, and the Dark Beasts. Purchasing the Jūbi does not grant the free Kekkei Genkai that comes from the individual Tailed Beasts that comprise it, though you can still buy both the Ten-Tails and any individual Tailed Beast. If you purchase all five Genryū, you may choose whether or not to fuse them into the Light Genryū.\n\nIf you wish, you can pay an additional 400 JP on top of a Beast's base cost to not only become its Jinchūriki but to become the Beast itself. You may take the place of the existing Beast, become a copy of it, or simply begin the Jump already occupying that role.\n\nShould you become your Beast(s), you can toggle between your purchased race and Beast form. You may still channel Beast chakra in your racial body through chakra shrouds and partial transformations. Your racial form also receives all of the benefits a host would normally receive. Abilities that ordinarily demand absolute trust, such as Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, instead require months of dedicated training to achieve full control. You no longer need a seal, and the mindscape now lets you communicate telepathically with others of your kind.\n\nIn future Jumps, you may attempt to establish a connection with any monster, but if you could not normally communicate with them you still will not understand them. If you have purchased multiple Beasts, you may decide whether to maintain several Beast forms or merge them into one hybrid form.\n\nIf you have taken more than one entity, you may fuse them into a single being regardless of category. The appearance and rationale are entirely up to you, and the combined entity possesses the powers of all its components.",

Their durability is increased to massive levels, such that Madara was able to withstand Might Guy's attacks practically unharmed, even when he had released seven of the Eight Gates.

While you start with a total of five bodies, you can increase your total stock in the same way that you would replace destroyed ones.

The former is the one Hidan made most famous. In order to use it, the user must draw, in their own blood, the symbol of Jashin and they must remain in the center of that symbol. While in that symbol, the user must then drink the blood of their target. Once the blood is drunk the user's skin turns black with white markings, resembling a skeleton. Once this occurs the victim is linked to the user until the user leaves the circle. While linked, any injury inflicted on the user, whether self-inflicted or through enemy attack, is inflicted upon the target whose blood they drank as well. The second technique is activated much the same way as the first. The only difference being that the user doesn’t drink the blood and instead uses it on a puppet. This links the puppet and the target together, so that any damage inflicted onto the puppet is inflicted onto the user. However, even if the target dies, the connection isn’t severed, leaving the target’s corpse as a puppet.",

By utilizing the chakra- enhancing radiation from the meteorite, villagers could obtain supernatural chakra levels and manipulate its shape and form to match various situations. This enhanced chakra is called Star-Chakra. Its most prominent use is the Mysterious Peacock Method.\n\nThis star and the Mysterious Peacock Method are now yours. The meteorite's radiation greatly improves the user's chakra, but it is incredibly damaging to their physical body. Even to those who master the technique, there is still a high chance that their body will slowly weaken and eventually perish. Because you paid CP for this however, this drawback does not apply to you or others you do not want it to apply to. You can use the meteorite to let others learn this technique or you can fuse with it. When the meteorite is fused to you, it grants an enormous increase in chakra and an incredible increase in the control over the Mysterious Peacock Method. You can safely defuse again with a few minutes of meditation.\n\nThe Mysterious Peacock Method itself manifests in the form of a feather-shaped array behind the user, hence the name. This chakra is dense and easily manipulated into various shapes to create techniques, making it one of the most versatile jutsu around. Examples of shapes produced from this technique are thin and thick ropes, wings, beasts, and dragons. It is also possible to shoot blasts of star chakra at the opponent.\n\nYou never have to worry about the meteor running out of radiation either. It will continue to produce its special radiation endlessly.",

Of course, this species can also be used for other purposes as well. They can help to expel poison from the body, distribute stolen chakra to others, or impersonate their host to act as a decoy. Much like Bikochū, they can also be used as a method of tracking by observing the target and returning to their host to report what they heard and the target's location. Once a Kikaichū has locked onto a chakra signature, they can continue to follow it so long as the target remains within a certain range. Finally, by planting a female of the species onto a person, that person can be tracked via smell. They also breed very rapidly. If the population is decimated, so long as one survives, it’s only a matter of days before it has been fully restored.",

They are not capable of nullifying Senjutsu, however.\n\nYour Truth-Seeking Balls will regenerate if they are destroyed or somehow expended.\n\nYou gain ten for free for each of the following you possess: Jūbi Jinchūriki, Six Paths Senjutsu, and Tenseigan. These sources stack, so if you have two or all three, you gain 20 or 30 orbs for free, respectively. Orbs granted by Six Paths Senjutsu and Tenseigan Chakra Mode are only present while using those abilities.\n\nIf you possess any two or more of Jūbi Jinchūriki, Six Paths Senjutsu, or Tenseigan, the price per purchased orb is discounted to 50 IP.",

That energy is then used to produce a single Chakra Fruit, which grows over the course of a thousand years, but can be harvested earlier if need be.\n\nBecause you’re paying with IP, your version is a little different, the majority of the conditions and drawbacks associated with its growth being waived. The tree’s growth will not drain away the life of the planet, though you may cause it to do so if you wish. You can still feed your God Tree with bloodshed or donations of energy to accelerate its growth, but it is no longer a requirement. Live sacrifices will provide bigger boosts to its growth than donating energy, and stronger sacrifices will speed things up more than weaker ones. Similarly, an Ōtsutsuki sacrifice is no longer required to make its Chakra Fruit bloom, but a sacrifice with an equivalent level of power or greater will cause the Chakra Fruit to provide an even greater amount of power than normal in addition to speeding up its growth.\n\nIf you use a sacrifice that does not possess Chakra, but instead possesses some other form of innate energy, you may cause the resulting Chakra Fruit to grant immense reserves of that form of energy instead of Chakra (examples could range from gaining the power of Aura from RWBY by sacrificing enough people possessing it to sacrificing Darkseid to gain the Omega Force). Likewise, if the planet you plant the God Tree on is imbued with some unique natural energy (for example, the Lifestream in Final Fantasy 7), you may make use of it to alter the properties of the Chakra Fruit it produces. Upon absorbing a sacrifice or type of energy, your God Tree will always have the option of switching the nature of its Chakra Fruit to reproduce it in the future, even without access to a repeat sacrifice or that same kind of energy.\n\nFinally, if you wish to use your matured God Tree as a weapon rather than as a tool for growth, you may cause it to revert to its seedling form, that of a Ten-Tailed Beast. This beast will be unwaveringly loyal to you, but it can only be produced if the tree has matured enough to produce a Chakra Fruit.\n\nTime dedicated to growing your God Tree’s Chakra Fruit is conserved across Jumps, so no need to worry about your progress being reset each time you move on. You cannot use a floating discount to buy this item.\n\nYes, Ōtsutsuki Jumpers can use Kāma or other 1-Ups and sacrifice themselves for the fruit's growth multiple times if they want to. If you wish to have a different kind of tree be the final result, you may change the aesthetics of the tree if you wish.\n\n[DISCOUNT: Jūbi Jinchūriki/Ōtsutsuki 2nd Tier]",

By the time your Jump starts, he’ll have had several generations to plan and prepare for your arrival, to guide the course of history itself in a way that will give him the most leverage to take advantage of you...or eliminate you outright. Be careful Jumper. For all that he takes on the role of a non-combatant, Black Zetsu is a formidable adversary, having spent centuries singlehandedly manipulating the history of all shinobi for the sake of achieving his singular goal. Depending on how he prepares for you, the world you arrive in may not be one you recognize.",

Well, you’d best familiarize yourself with it now, because that path is the one you walk now.\n\nYour past powers, perks, and even your items have been stripped away from you, taking on the form of nine great beasts. These beasts, the Tailed Jumpers, are personifications of the abilities you have lost, and have been sealed within nine different humans from across the continent that certainly do not deserve your hard-earned power. They are undeserving, unworthy to possess the power that is rightfully yours, so what recourse do you have but to reclaim it for yourself?\n\nTo clear this Scenario, you must take back what you have lost. To do so, you must track down each Tailed Jumper and extract them from their hosts. You will be granted a special fūinjutsu unique to this Scenario that will allow you to pull the Tailed Jumpers from their hosts and back into you. Whether or not this will be fatal to the host is up to you, though both the host and the Tailed Jumper inside them will resist the extraction process. With each Tailed Jumper you reclaim, the powers and items it holds will be returned to you.\n\nOf course, if you had to attempt this with nothing, the Scenario could very well prove itself impossible. For this reason, you will retain your chakra, your intelligence and experience, and all of the abilities purchased in this Jump. Likewise, if you possessed perks, powers, or items from past Jumps that would render this Scenario impossible, such as an immunity to being sealed or outright invulnerability, those perks have been left out of the Tailed Jumpers and will only be returned to you once you have reclaimed all nine.\n\nIf this is your first Jump, the perks, abilities, and items you have purchased in this document will be split between yourself and the Tailed Jumpers instead\n\n\nRewards:\nFirst, you gain Alt-Forms based on each of the Tailed Jumpers, enhancing the abilities that they were comprised of.\n\nSecondly, you gain the ability to fission your perks, powers, and items from yourself, converting them into new Tailed Jumper forms possessing the powers you placed within them. These created Tailed Jumpers will be loyal to you and follow your commands.\n\nAnd finally, you have the ability to temporarily enter a powerful Ten-Tailed Jumper form. Just as the Ten Tails far surpassed the sum of the nine individual Tailed Beasts, so too does the power of this form surpass the abilities of the Tailed Jumpers that compose your being. In other words, while in this state, all of your perks and powers are enhanced.",

Where ninjutsu is the practice of wielding chakra for combat, ninshū is the practice of using chakra to bring others closer together, using understanding to bring peace to a war-torn world. Sadly, after his death, the people of the world turned away from ninshū in favor of using the destructive power of ninjutsu, and the religion was lost to the ages.\n\nUntil now. You must take up the Sage’s mantle, not as a legendary shinobi of unparalleled might, but as a prophet to spread the peaceful message of Ninshū across the world. This is no easy task, Jumper.\n\nIn order to clear this Scenario, Ninshū must become an internationally recognized practice, with a minimum of one major sect established in each of the primary nations. The followers of these sects must be truly devout practitioners of Ninshū, living their lives according to the teachings of the Sage. Achieve this, and you will have your rewards.\n\nRewards:\nYou will be free to take the religion with you to future Jumps and you will be recognized as a priest/priestess of Ninshū in future worlds, and the peaceful religion will have roots in future Jumps as well. You may toggle this option at the start of any given Jump, choosing between having it not present, having it present as a major religion (20% of the population, comparable to modern day Islam), having it present as a much smaller, secret religion, or having it be a dead religion of which you are the only member.\n\nThe religion’s influence will likely vary depending on the settings of future Jumps but should generally be considered comparable to other local religions of similar size. You may decide whether Ninshū is spread across the world or more localized in its practice at the start of the Jump.\n\nYou also possess an incredible capacity for spreading peace and understanding across large populations, allowing you to end multigenerational feuds, ideological wars, and other large-scale or long-term conflicts.",

If a character shows significant growth over the course of the series, such as by gaining new techniques or achieving new power, then you will fight them multiple times over. Characters whose full strength depends on fighting alongside specific allies may be fought in one-on-many battles in addition to their own one-on-one battles. Injuries, resource expenditure, and exhaustion carries forwards between battles, though you will get a fifteen-minute break (which you can skip if you don’t need it) every five fights. You only get one chance at clearing the tournament, so make sure you’re ready before you start it up.\n\nDeath in this tournament will not result in a Chain Failure, though it will mean you do not receive the Scenario rewards.\n\nRewards:\nFirst, whenever you fight alone against a single opponent in a one-on-one duel, the strength of all your abilities skyrocket, increasing dozens of time over. \n\nSecond, your stamina and endurance are increased to the point that they become functionally limitless. You can never be physically or mentally exhausted ever again. Your chakra and other pools are not exempt from this boost either, all of them now refilling impossibly quickly. \n\nFinally, you gain the ability to induce a similar consequence-free tournament once per Jump wherein you may fight every character that has engaged in combat over the course of that setting’s history under the same rules as this Scenario. Growth and development gained from this tournament will remain, but injuries, deaths, and loss of equipment will not.",

The greatest power this world has seen, now split apart into nine fragments, Tailed Beasts that, while impressive, are nevertheless a sum lesser than its original whole. You must claim this power for yourself, and become a god made manifest in this world.\n\nThis Scenario’s objective is deceptively simple, despite its inherent difficulty. You must become the Jinchūriki of the Ten Tails. Yes, you still have to do this if you’re starting the Jump as a Jūbi Jinchūriki. There’s more than one Ten Tails, after all. To accomplish your goal, you must track down each of the nine Tailed Beasts, extract them from their current Jinchūriki, and seal them within yourself. In truth, you do not need to take the Beasts in their entirety, merely extracting a significant portion of their being would be sufficient. Naturally, this will not be an easy task to complete. The Jinchūriki of the Tailed Beasts are granted considerable power by their passengers, and while they may be feared and reviled by their villages, even the most spiteful nations recognizes their strategic value and will fight to keep them from your hands. At the end of the Jump, the original Tailed Beasts are released if you wish.\n\nUpon subsuming all nine Tailed Beasts, they will merge and become the Ten Tails within you, granting you the immense power deserving of its Jinchūriki.\n\nRewards:\nFirst, despite being the Jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails rather than all nine individual Tailed Beasts, you gain access to their forms and their abilities.\n\nSecondly, you are able to project the Tailed Beasts out into the world, losing access to their chakra while they are separate from you. You may decide whether or not these Tailed Beasts retain the personalities of the originals. They are loyal to you either way.\n\nThirdly, you can turn others into a temporary Jinchūriki of sorts for any of your Tailed Beasts with but a touch. While your Tailed Beast dwells within someone else, you cannot harness the powers inherent to them until they are part of you once more. You may recover any distributed Tailed Beasts with a thought, regardless of distance. Taking back the power of the Tailed Beasts from temporary Jinchūriki will not kill them.\n\nFinally, your Rinnegan will evolve into a Rinne Sharingan.",

            "description": "Throughout the ages, the children of the Sage of Six Paths, Indra and Asura, have reincarnated time and time again, with each incarnation coming into conflict over the ideal path to peace. But it seems the Sage had a third child, one whose most recent reincarnation… is you. Much like Indra and Asura, who believed the path to peace lay in power and love respectively, your ancestor had a philosophy of their own. Perhaps it was the same as one brother or the other, or perhaps it was an alternate road to peace. Regardless of the path you choose, whether it be Indra’s philosophy of reaching peace through power, Asura’s philosophy of doing so through love, or a path of your own choosing, you will clash with your fellow reincarnates, whose identities may vary depending on the Drawbacks you have taken, and must strive to reshape the shinobi world according to your inherited philosophy.\n\nTo clear this Scenario, you must achieve world peace. This peace must last at least ten years. There can still be incidental violence, ranging from petty crimes to the odd terrorist movement, but the nations and their general populace must be at peace and content with that peace. If you have not reached the start of the era of peace by the end of ten years, you may continue striving towards achieving it, for up to a century past the normal end of the Jump without Drawbacks.\n\nIf the ten years of peace would take you beyond that limit, you may stay until you die, the era ends, or you reach a full ten years of peace. Should the peace end before those ten years are up, the Jump ends, and you fail the Scenario. Should you die outside the bounds you have set for your Jump while the era of peace is ongoing but has not yet reached a full ten years, time will continue in the Jump. If the peace lasts beyond your death for the remainder of the ten-year requirement, the Scenario is still considered cleared. It is a powerful thing to create a peace that will last beyond your own era, after all.\n\nRewards:\nFor achieving such a tremendous and monumental goal, your rewards will be great indeed.\n\nFirstly, you now have both the Six Paths Yin Power and the Six Paths Yang Power, symbolized by a sun and moon on the palm of your hands. You may conceal them if you wish. Individually, the Yang Power uses physical energy to control vitality, allowing the user to perform absurd acts of healing with a mere touch. Meanwhile, the Yin Power uses spiritual energy to control imagination, projecting ideas into physical forms. By infusing the Six Paths Power into your techniques, you can elevate them to greater heights, such as transforming Amaterasu into Hinokagutsuchi or turning a Rasengan into an Amenomihashira. But what they can do alone pales in comparison to the two Powers working in harmony.\n\nCombined, these powers allow you to perform the Six Paths – Chibaku Tensei by touching the target with both hands. This ultimate sealing technique will trap the target inside a moon-sized mass of stone and dirt and launches them into orbit. The only way the victim of this technique will be able to escape is if they are summoned out of the moon, either by the user or someone with their powers.\n\nBut that is only part of what you could do. Using the Six Paths Power, you will be able to perform the Sage of Six Paths’ most vaunted technique, the Creation of All Things. This almighty technique allows the user to turn their ideas into reality and to create life by using Yin Chakra to give ideas physical form and then use Yang Chakra to breathe vitality into those forms. Initially, this will be very taxing to perform but, as in all things, practice and training will make it easier.\n\nFinally, there is one more boon you receive. Prior to entering a new Jump, you may choose to designate yourself the reincarnation of a deceased individual from the setting. This doesn’t necessarily grant you any extra powers beyond a natural affinity for some of the things they could do that were teachable, but it gives you memories stretching back dozens of generations and it can grant you some measure of influence in certain circles. Naturally, you can only be a reincarnation of someone who has already died by the time you enter the Jump in question",

For example, Naruto has his eyes change color, his pupils turn into slits and his nails and teeth elongate, becoming more fox-like in nature.\n\nIn the second state, the user’s body changes massively, becoming enveloped entirely with red chakra and taking on a form that becomes closer to the beast within as more and more tails are drawn out.",
