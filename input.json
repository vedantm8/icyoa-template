Of hidden darkness and\u2026aliens?\n\nWhatever it includes, it begins on a continent composed of the Elemental Nations. Within most of these nations are special cities called Hidden Villages, which are run by Ninja, mercenaries trained to use the power of Chakra to perform superhuman feats such as enhancing speed and strength, manifesting the five elements, creating illusions, and much, much more. This is a world that is fraught with danger and conflict, though it currently enjoys a somewhat strained peace. Not for long, however. There are powerful forces stirring in the shadows. Hidden Sand and Hidden Sound are preparing for their assault on Konoha, and the Akatsuki have begun to move. You begin your journey in this world the day before Naruto\u2019s graduation exam."
