Of hidden darkness and\u2026aliens?\n\nWhatever it includes, it begins on a continent composed of the Elemental Nations. Within most of these nations are special cities called Hidden Villages, which are run by Ninja, mercenaries trained to use the power of Chakra to perform superhuman feats such as enhancing speed and strength, manifesting the five elements, creating illusions, and much, much more. This is a world that is fraught with danger and conflict, though it currently enjoys a somewhat strained peace. Not for long, however. There are powerful forces stirring in the shadows. Hidden Sand and Hidden Sound are preparing for their assault on Konoha, and the Akatsuki have begun to move. You begin your journey in this world the day before Naruto\u2019s graduation exam."

                "text": "SAGE MODE [400/800 CP]\n\nMany view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that is not true. A Sage is something more, a being who does not just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world.\n\nSages utilize a specialized form of jutsu called senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage's strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced.\n\nBy utilizing senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that before, then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu, the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques.\n\nAs you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound.\n\nYou may instead gain a custom set of unique abilities of a similar power level, based on where and how you learned Sage Mode. If you wish to have access to additional versions, you can pay 50 CP extra for each.\n\nHowever, this comes with a downside. If too much natural energy is taken in, it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still. If in a fight, you cannot stay utterly still, then your reserve of senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on.\n\nBy paying for it here, you will find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra. Even in a life and death battle, the process will always go correctly.\n\nNormally you would require large chakra reserves, but you have found a way around that. Another thing to remember is if you continually practice the use of senjutsu, the time needed to refill your senjutsu reserves will decrease.\n\nFor an additional 400 CP (FREE: J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki), you can obtain Six Paths Senjutsu, a version of senjutsu vastly superior to regular senjutsu.\n\nFor starters, every boost you get from regular senjutsu is massively enhanced to the point you that you can sense beings like Madara's Limbo clones and dodge lightspeed attacks.\n\nSecondly, you are immune to all but senjutsu enhanced attacks. Thirdly, Six Paths Senjutsu enhances any d\u014djutsu you possess. An example of this is Obito using Kamui and what little Six Paths chakra he had left to somehow give his Sharingan to Kakashi temporarily while he was in Limbo. Another example is Kakashi being able to use the perfect Susanoo without any of the prior forms.\n\nFinally, you gain access to Yin and Yang natures as well as Yin-Yang release and Truth-Seeking Balls along with the ability of flight.\n\nAs far as abilities go, the versions the J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki have and what Naruto gets are the same but with different appearances. Naruto's eyes changed to be similar to when he uses Sage mode in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode but without the markings or the chakra cloak, the J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki either has fleshy mutations like Obito or clothes made of senjutsu chakra like Madara.\n\nFor the purposes of this perk, if you are not a J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki, assume that your Six Paths Sage Mode is similar in appearance to Naruto's, only tailored to what animal summon you chose to learn from.",

Overlapping abilities stack, enhancing the strength of their effects, so if you have Kurama Clan and Sharingan, you can quite literally kill with a look. Also, if you select multiple bloodlines, you can decide which of those clans you are born into. Of course, you can decide not to be born into one.\n\nYou can exchange CP to BLP at a 1:2 ratio.\n\nFor bloodlines that are combinations you require the specific elemental natures in order to purchase those bloodlines.

Note that the Jinch\u016briki General Perk is not required to purchase a Beast from this section.\n\nYou may choose to be a Jinch\u016briki of any Beast on offer in this section, and you may purchase more than one if you so choose. At your discretion, you may replace the canon Jinch\u016briki of the Beast you select, though this will not grant you any of their abilities that do not stem from their Jinch\u016briki status, and it depends on you to befriend your Beast(s).\n\nBy default, the seal that holds your Beast prevents them from affecting you emotionally or mentally, but you can remove this effect to gain 200 JP. Your seal also prevents its escape. If you were to ever die, the Beast would die with you, and if you were to come back, it would still be imprisoned inside you.\n\nYou can control the seal - the more open it is, the more chakra you can draw from your Beast(s). Open it too much without a strong bond and they may try to drain your chakra in return. This control is separate for every Beast if you have more than one. You can decide the seal's design and, if you host multiple Beasts, how many seals appear on your body, including hiding them entirely.\n\nAnother feature of being a Jinch\u016briki is a mindscape - a mental space where you can interact with your Beast(s). Its appearance is entirely up to you and, if you buy multiple Beasts, each can receive their own mindscape if you so wish.\n\nThe Beasts on offer here can be divided into three sets: the Tailed Beasts, the Genry\u016b, and the Dark Beasts. Purchasing the J\u016bbi does not grant the free Kekkei Genkai that comes from the individual Tailed Beasts that comprise it, though you can still buy both the Ten-Tails and any individual Tailed Beast. If you purchase all five Genry\u016b, you may choose whether or not to fuse them into the Light Genry\u016b.\n\nIf you wish, you can pay an additional 400 JP on top of a Beast's base cost to not only become its Jinch\u016briki but to become the Beast itself. You may take the place of the existing Beast, become a copy of it, or simply begin the Jump already occupying that role.\n\nShould you become your Beast(s), you can toggle between your purchased race and Beast form. You may still channel Beast chakra in your racial body through chakra shrouds and partial transformations. Your racial form also receives all of the benefits a host would normally receive. Abilities that ordinarily demand absolute trust, such as Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, instead require months of dedicated training to achieve full control. You no longer need a seal, and the mindscape now lets you communicate telepathically with others of your kind.\n\nIn future Jumps, you may attempt to establish a connection with any monster, but if you could not normally communicate with them you still will not understand them. If you have purchased multiple Beasts, you may decide whether to maintain several Beast forms or merge them into one hybrid form.\n\nIf you have taken more than one entity, you may fuse them into a single being regardless of category. The appearance and rationale are entirely up to you, and the combined entity possesses the powers of all its components.",

If you are not compatible with a host, the body will start to reject you, though it is guaranteed to last for at least long enough for you to use Living Corpse Reincarnation again.

If you bought the Master of Biology and Sage Mode perks you also gain knowledge of how to make Orochimaru\u2019s curse marks (even the filler curse mark Mizuki has). So long as a curse mark exists, you\u2019ll never truly die. However, you\u2019ll be bound to the curse mark as a disembodied spirit until someone frees you.",

Your entire internal structure has become composed of countless thick grey threads that now hold your body together. Due to your ragdoll nature, you can separate and control individual body parts so long as they are connected via the threads. You can even manipulate them underground. These threads can pierce the flesh and bodies of others, allowing you to remove their organs, or to be more specific, remove their hearts and integrate them into your own body, extending your life. In order for you to die, you have to be killed as many times as you have hearts. However, you have a limit of 5 hearts in your body, including your original one. On the bright side, you also gain the nature affinity of that heart. For example, if the original owner is a wind user, you gain the wind element. You can also detach those hearts and have them take a body of their own made by the threads, with each heart able to attack individually. Similarly, integrating the heart of an individual with their own special abilities will grant you access to those powers. Post-Jump, you may store any extra hearts inside your body rather than on your back.",

The only limit to this are limbs taken from you and are not destroyed; those types of injuries cannot be healed and the limb in question must be reattached, even the head.

The former is the one Hidan made most famous. In order to use it, the user must draw, in their own blood, the symbol of Jashin and they must remain in the center of that symbol. While in that symbol, the user must then drink the blood of their target. Once the blood is drunk the user's skin turns black with white markings, resembling a skeleton. Once this occurs the victim is linked to the user until the user leaves the circle. While linked, any injury inflicted on the user, whether self-inflicted or through enemy attack, is inflicted upon the target whose blood they drank as well. The second technique is activated much the same way as the first. The only difference being that the user doesn\u2019t drink the blood and instead uses it on a puppet. This links the puppet and the target together, so that any damage inflicted onto the puppet is inflicted onto the user. However, even if the target dies, the connection isn\u2019t severed, leaving the target\u2019s corpse as a puppet.",
