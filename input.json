Of hidden darkness and\u2026aliens?\n\nWhatever it includes, it begins on a continent composed of the Elemental Nations. Within most of these nations are special cities called Hidden Villages, which are run by Ninja, mercenaries trained to use the power of Chakra to perform superhuman feats such as enhancing speed and strength, manifesting the five elements, creating illusions, and much, much more. This is a world that is fraught with danger and conflict, though it currently enjoys a somewhat strained peace. Not for long, however. There are powerful forces stirring in the shadows. Hidden Sand and Hidden Sound are preparing for their assault on Konoha, and the Akatsuki have begun to move. You begin your journey in this world the day before Naruto\u2019s graduation exam."

                "text": "SAGE MODE [400/800 CP]\n\nMany view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that is not true. A Sage is something more, a being who does not just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world.\n\nSages utilize a specialized form of jutsu called senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage's strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced.\n\nBy utilizing senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that before, then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu, the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques.\n\nAs you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound.\n\nYou may instead gain a custom set of unique abilities of a similar power level, based on where and how you learned Sage Mode. If you wish to have access to additional versions, you can pay 50 CP extra for each.\n\nHowever, this comes with a downside. If too much natural energy is taken in, it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still. If in a fight, you cannot stay utterly still, then your reserve of senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on.\n\nBy paying for it here, you will find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra. Even in a life and death battle, the process will always go correctly.\n\nNormally you would require large chakra reserves, but you have found a way around that. Another thing to remember is if you continually practice the use of senjutsu, the time needed to refill your senjutsu reserves will decrease.\n\nFor an additional 400 CP (FREE: J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki), you can obtain Six Paths Senjutsu, a version of senjutsu vastly superior to regular senjutsu.\n\nFor starters, every boost you get from regular senjutsu is massively enhanced to the point you that you can sense beings like Madara's Limbo clones and dodge lightspeed attacks.\n\nSecondly, you are immune to all but senjutsu enhanced attacks. Thirdly, Six Paths Senjutsu enhances any d\u014djutsu you possess. An example of this is Obito using Kamui and what little Six Paths chakra he had left to somehow give his Sharingan to Kakashi temporarily while he was in Limbo. Another example is Kakashi being able to use the perfect Susanoo without any of the prior forms.\n\nFinally, you gain access to Yin and Yang natures as well as Yin-Yang release and Truth-Seeking Balls along with the ability of flight.\n\nAs far as abilities go, the versions the J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki have and what Naruto gets are the same but with different appearances. Naruto's eyes changed to be similar to when he uses Sage mode in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode but without the markings or the chakra cloak, the J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki either has fleshy mutations like Obito or clothes made of senjutsu chakra like Madara.\n\nFor the purposes of this perk, if you are not a J\u016bbi Jinch\u016briki, assume that your Six Paths Sage Mode is similar in appearance to Naruto's, only tailored to what animal summon you chose to learn from.",

If you possess multiple bloodlines, you can merge them together and if you have d\u014djutsu as well, you can merge them into one d\u014djutsu. Overlapping abilities stack, enhancing the strength of their effects, so if you have Kurama Clan and Sharingan, you can quite literally kill with a look. Also, if you select multiple bloodlines, you can decide which of those clans you are born into. Of course, you can decide not to be born into one.\n\nYou can exchange CP to BLP at a 1:2 ratio.\n\nFor bloodlines that are combinations you require the specific elemental natures in order to purchase those bloodlines.
